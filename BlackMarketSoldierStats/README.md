# Black Market Soldier Stats

XCOM 2 mod that shows the stats of soldiers for sale at the Black Market.

## Settings

The mod has the following options that are configurable via Mod
Config Menu:

*Highlight above/below average stats*

If activated, the stat values will be color-coded to indicate if it is an
above average (green), average (white) or below average (red) stat value.
The average value of a stat is determined by taking the average value at
Rookie level and adding all progressions up to the rank of the Black Market
soldier.

*Assign a cost to revealing the stats*

If you prefer to attach a cost to revealing the stats of a Black Market
soldier (similar to revealing hidden Dark Events), both the resource type
(Intel or Supplies) and the amount to be paid are configurable in the mod
settings.

*Require Sectoid autopsy before showing Psi Offense*

There is an option to hide the "Psi Offense" stat until the Sectoid autopsy
has been completed. This option is primarily designed for players of Long War
of the Chosen, aligning it with how displaying the stat is handled in that mod.

## Compatibility

This mod can be activated for existing campaigns. It's compatible with both
vanilla as well as War of the Chosen.

When the option to assign a cost to revealing stats is used, you cannot safely
remove the mod from the campaign anymore.

## Credits

For the sake of a consistent user experience, the stats layout is the same as
in AstralDescend's [Stats on New Promotion Screen](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1716973380).
The side panel idea was inspired by [Extended Personnel Info](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1458945379)
by the same author.
