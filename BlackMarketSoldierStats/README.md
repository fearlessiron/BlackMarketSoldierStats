# Black Market Cost Strings

XCOM 2 mod that shows the stats of soldiers for sale at the Black Market.

## Compatibility

This mod can be activated for existing campaigns. It's compatible with both vanilla
as well as War of the Chosen.

## Credits

For the sake of a consistent user experience, the stats layout is the same as
in AstralDescend's [Stats on New Promotion Screen](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1716973380).
The side panel idea was inspired by [Extended Personnel Info](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1458945379)
by the same author.
