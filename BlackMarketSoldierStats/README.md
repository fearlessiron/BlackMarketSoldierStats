# Black Market Soldier Stats

XCOM 2 mod that shows the stats of soldiers for sale at the Black Market.

Optionally, a cost can be assigned to revealing the stats. Both the resource
type (Intel or Supplies) and the amount to be paid are configurable via Mod
Config Menu.

Additionally, there is an option to hide the "Psi Offense" stat until the
Sectoid autopsy has been completed. This option is primarily designed for
players of Long War of the Chosen, aligning it with how displaying the stat
is handled in that mod.

## Compatibility

This mod can be activated for existing campaigns. It's compatible with both
vanilla as well as War of the Chosen.

When the option to assign a cost to revealing stats is used, you cannot safely
remove the mod from the campaign anymore.

## Credits

For the sake of a consistent user experience, the stats layout is the same as
in AstralDescend's [Stats on New Promotion Screen](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1716973380).
The side panel idea was inspired by [Extended Personnel Info](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1458945379)
by the same author.
