# Black Market Soldier Stats

XCOM 2 mod that shows the stats of soldiers for sale at the Black Market.

Optionally, a cost can be assigned to revealing the stats. Both the resource
type (Intel or Supplies) and the amount to be paid are configurable via Mod
Config Menu.

## Compatibility

This mod can be activated for existing campaigns. It's compatible with both
vanilla as well as War of the Chosen.

When the option to assign a cost to revealing stats is used, you cannot safely
remove the mod from the campaign anymore.

## Credits

For the sake of a consistent user experience, the stats layout is the same as
in AstralDescend's [Stats on New Promotion Screen](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1716973380).
The side panel idea was inspired by [Extended Personnel Info](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1458945379)
by the same author.
